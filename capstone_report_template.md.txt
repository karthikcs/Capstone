## I. Definition
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Project Overview
The commutes through flights have helped us to overcome the barrier of geography.They have become very
common among the individuals, might be a trip or a business meeting. As the number of people who travel
have increased, the number of airlines and airports have also increased to make a passenger's life much
easier. The sizes of the airports differs from one to another based on the population of the passengers and
number of incoming and outgoing flights in the airports. There are different types of flights, in this problem we
mainly focus on domestic flights. There are nearly 44K aircrafts that lands daily on average in US and 87K
flights that crisscross US everyday on avg. From this we can infer that the Air traffic is huge and there will be
delays in takeoffs and landings. The delay in flight is very painful for passengers and airlines. This could lead
to very serious problem such as missing important business meetings or a sport competition etc which might
lead to huge losses. This mainly creates stressful situations among the passengers. There are cases where
passengers have missed connecting flights and have waited double the time than they expected.
Due to this problem it has become very important that passengers are well informed in advance so that they
can plan their trip accordingly. If we have data on flights arrival and departure timings of its everyday trip we
can capture the pattern of these delays and predict them accordingly based on the data(history) that we have.
This is the main role of our project.

### Problem Statement
Booking flights online have become very common through websites. There are tons of websites that do flight
bookings, they provide details such as arrival, departure time, fare etc. But what if they provide details on the
delays? This will help users or passengers to decide or plan on their trip upfront. The overhead of delays or
surprise delays will be reduced to some extent.
This prediction also helps airlines to avoid delays through planning and thus help both passengers to have a
good journey and airlines to become more efficient. We can predict these delays using regression models.

### Metrics

As our problem is based on prediction its a regression problem and large differences between actual and predicted are punished more in MSE than in MAE. Therefore we have taken MSE as our evaluation metric. As we have tried different models including benchmark model which is linear regression they all should have common evaluation metrics so that we can compare which is the better model. For this purpose we are using MSE as a common metric. MSE is given by:
![MSE2](https://github.com/srividya129/Capstone/blob/master/MSE2.png)
MSE basically measures average squared error of our predictions. For each point, it calculates square difference between the predictions and the target and then average those values.

The higher this value, the worse the model is. It is never negative, since we’re squaring the individual prediction-wise errors before summing them, but would be zero for a perfect model .

## II. Analysis

### Data Exploration

Each entry of the input file `flights.csv` file corresponds to a flight and we see that more than 5'800'000 flights have been recorded in 2015. These flights are described according to 31 variables. Here are few variables that I explain:
Inputs from the file:
- **YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DAY_OF_WEEK**: dates of the flight <br/>
- **AIRLINE**: An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airline <br/>
- **ORIGIN_AIRPORT** and **DESTINATION_AIRPORT**: code attributed by IATA to identify the airports <br/>
- **SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE** and **SCHEDULED_ARRIVAL** : scheduled times of take-off and landing <br/> 
- **DEPARTURE_TIME** and **ARRIVAL_TIME**: real times at which take-off and landing took place <br/> 
- **DEPARTURE_DELAY** and **ARRIVAL_DELAY**: difference (in minutes) between planned and real times <br/> 
- **DISTANCE**: distance (in miles)  <br/>
Output:
Y-Predicted delay values
An additional file of this dataset, the `airports.csv` file, gives a more exhaustive description of the airports

For easy computations I will be taking subset of this data which is of one month January 2015.

Next I will clean the data by changing the date time format of time variables for convenience. Also as there are few missing values but very less. I remove them and remove all NANs. 
The statistics of the the delay grouped by each airline is as follows:

### Exploratory Visualization

<<IMG pie chart>>>>
<<IMG delay dispersion>>

Considering the first pie chart that gives the percentage of flights per airline, we see that there is some disparity between the carriers. For exemple, *Southwest Airlines* accounts for ~20% of the flights which is similar to the number of flights chartered by the 7 tiniest airlines. However, if we have a look at the second pie chart, we see that here, on the contrary, the differences among airlines are less pronounced. Excluding *Hawaiian Airlines* and *Alaska Airlines* that report extremely low mean delays, we obtain that a value of 11+or-7 minutes would correctly represent all mean delays. Note that this value is quite low which mean that the standard for every airline is to respect the schedule !

Finally, the figure at the bottom makes a census of all the delays that were measured in January 2015. This representation gives a feeling on the dispersion of data and put in perspective the relative homogeneity that appeared in the second pie chart. Indeed, we see that while all mean delays are around 10 minutes, this low value is a consequence of the fact that a majority of flights take off on time. However, we see that occasionally, we can face really large delays that can reach a few tens of hours !

The large majority of short delays is visible in the next figure:


<<Img short and large delays>>


This figure gives a count of the delays of less than 5 minutes, those in the range 5 < t < 45 min and finally, the delays greater than 45 minutes. Hence, we wee that independently of the airline, delays greater than 45 minutes only account for a few percents. However, the proportion of delays in these three groups depends on the airline: as an exemple, in the case of 
*SkyWest Airlines*, the delays greater than 45 minutes are only lower by ~30% with respect to delays in the range 5 < t < 45 min. Things are better for *SoutWest Airlines*  since delays greater than 45 minutes are 4 times less frequent than delays in the range 5 < t < 45 min.

### Algorithms and Techniques
Here we are using the following models:
-Linear regression
-Polynomial regression
-Light GBM 

Here I will use Linear regression as benchmark model and later I move to polynomial regression as it provides of the relationship between the dependent and independent variable.Polynomial basically fits a wide range of curvature. Later we will use Light GBM as I wanted to try out a tree based model.
We split our data to train test and apply the above algorithms and compare the evaluation metrics.
The regularization technique ridge is also implemented for better outcome. We have also used Grid search technique to find best plynomial order n and alpha-coefficient of ridge regression.

### Benchmark
The below table gives the value of the MSE for each model that was used:



## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
